In week 5 Day 31 

I completed several hands-on activities. I explored the AWS Management Console, launched an EC2 instance using an SSH PEM key, and connected to it using the correct SSH username and password. I also accessed the EC2 instance through a browser after configuring the required settings.
I created an S3 bucket, uploaded an object, and also built a custom VPC with subnets, route tables, an internet gateway, and a security group configured for proper access. Finally, i practiced accessing a VM from the internet using SSH.
